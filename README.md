## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this mini-project is to apply key statistical methods to a dataset to extract insights, identify patterns, and make data-driven inferences. The project is structured into two main parts:

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
- Measures of Dispersion: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, IQR
- Frequency distribution and visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, etc.)

### 2. Inferential Statistics
- Sampling techniques and distribution
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing (Z-test, t-test, Chi-square test, ANOVA)
